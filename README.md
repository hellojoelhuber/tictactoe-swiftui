# TicTacToe-SwiftUI

The client-app for Tic-Tac-Toe, written in Swift & SwiftUI.

The client is only serviceable at this point. You can read more about my full-stack Tic-Tac-Toe app in [my article here](https://www.joelhuber.com/2022/06/13/full-stack-swift-tictactoe.html), where I also enumerate ways in which the client app can be improved in the future.
